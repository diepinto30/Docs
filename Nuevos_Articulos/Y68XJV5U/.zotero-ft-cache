Abstract — The objective of this research is to describe STEM education, even more so with the incorporation of art being STEAM, taking into account studies in science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics worldwide through a systematic literature review.
83 articles were taken from the Scopus database, selected through a methodology for engineering and education, based on the environments in which they are developed, the intervention of art and the contexts of STEAM education.
The results indicate that STEAM education is carried out in settings under educational policies and reforms to improve teaching - learning, requiring change and its integration into the curriculum, STEAM learning environments should be created based on the study plans of the Ministry of Education to integrate all subjects. The incorporation of art has allowed the development of new skills such as creativity and collaboration. On the other hand, the case studies that have given good results in countries such as: Malaysia, United Kingdom, Mexico, United States, China, Hong Kong, Australia, India and Indonesia, Japan, Germany, Qatar, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey where they make an adaptation of the curriculum and learning policies based on projects and technological design.
Keywords - innovation; steam; stem; tecnologyt.
I. INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1)
Currently individuals must have different skills to face the daily problems that arise, so education must provide the necessary tools where it is multidisciplinary that allow the integration of knowledge in a creative way, thus STEM education arises that allows individuals to develop the scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical part, but over time it has been proven that this is not enough, so the letter A is inserted in this

acronym, resulting in STEAM that includes the arts to this type of education, “the generation that will constitute the labor force of the future is expected to have the skills of 21st century like reasonable thinking, problem solving, communicating, having a facility with teamwork, innovativeness and productivity, working systematically, as well as utilizing the technology” [1], in addition “art infusion naturally shares some of the basic ideas and principles of STEAM education, thereby benefiting both art and non-art subject areas as the arts and artistic pedagogies are in place for the STEM subjects to be woven among them” [2].
This research allows exploring STEM - STEAM education and answering questions regarding the current state, environments in which they develop, how art intervenes in STEM education and contexts in which it develops.
In this research, a systematic review of the STEM - STEAM Art, Environments and Contexts literature has been carried out applying the Torres-Carrion method [3], which proposes a conceptual mindset, to obtain the research questions and build a script for Searches in the Scopus scientific databases. Three research questions related to STEAM education are proposed, in the end 83 valid documents were analyzed to answer the research questions.
II. SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW
The work has been carried out in three phases: planning, production and presentation of the proposed report in [3] that applies to engineering and education:

The implementation of Steam education is increasingly gaining ground in educational institutions, allowing to generate new skills in students with the integration of art, on the other hand, it is important to know in which environments this type of education is developed and implemented.
Research questions
Three research questions have been defined to address the environments and different contexts of STEAM education.
RQ1: ¿What environments are developed in STEM STEAM education? RQ2: ¿How does art intervene in STEM education? RQ3: ¿How has STEM -STEAM education been adapted in different contexts? Conceptual Mindset The conceptual mindset allows us to guide the systematic review regarding STEAM - STEM education, defined on the left side are the characteristics linked to this type of education, on the right side we find the concepts that are excluded from research and at the bottom are the words with which the searches were performed in the database.

STEM education environments are developed under policies given by governments and teachers apply them to offer opportunities, scholarships, alliances, networks and strategies with national and international companies and institutions so that students develop skills to innovate the fields of science, engineering, technology and mathematics.
The studies observed are based on the implementation of educational policies and reforms in scientific development to improve teaching - learning and training for teachers in STEM education, as countries that have designated good financing as States have done throughout the years. United, United Kingdom, Australia and England; On the other hand, inclusive policies are shown as strategic partnerships with other countries at the school level for the use of young people as qualified labor for future challenges in the industries.
It is necessary to mention that the development of STEM education is being limited in some countries due to educational policies that entail modifications and extensions of the secondary school curricula and the process of entering the university.

The development of STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) is changing learning since the arts are being integrated, forming this

education as a field, where theater projects are applied with robots which can interact with dance and sounds, combining science and engineering to bring plays to life, as well as STEMfocused prototypes based on crafts (puppets) that serve teachers to make teaching more innovative.

Creativity and collaboration are important skills to revolutionize education, today they can be combined with devices and augmented reality for interaction with images for surreal art classes, creating an educational environment in the visual arts with a variety of approaches with results positive for the student since it helps the compression, content retention and development of new skills.

Most of the implementations of Stem - Steam education are given in the countries of: Malaysia, United Kingdom, Mexico, United States, China, Hong Kong, Australia, India and Indonesia, Japan, Germany, Qatar, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, where they present different cases and that have given great results.
The results have been in the adaptation of the curriculum, curriculum and educational policies of project-based learning and in the technological design in studies of mathematics and engineering, both undergraduate and postgraduate based on real-world applications, in China include in their curricular units, Steam education.
As for teachers, they apply active learning techniques, resources and curricular materials to stimulate student participation, training, courses, workshops, electronic personal education planners, and Stem - Steam educational activity outreach programs are of importance for improving student performance.
It has been possible to observe as a success case the financing for the implementation of Steam in educational institutions, collective activities of teachers, in addition to development networks with teaching-learning resources, as well as the use of research methods to awaken in students the research and subsequently innovation integrating both mathematics, technology, engineering and art.
The design strategies and activity plans that students use to build and innovate their own objectives, in some cases making use of models and environments in 2D and 3D, scanners, printers, using programming, computing.
